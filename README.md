# KernelForge - Optimized Lernels for ML

I really only care about writing optimized kernel code, so this project will be completed as I find additional time... XD

I'm reviving this project to finish an old project using random Fourier features for kernel ML.


# Installation

```bash
conda env create -f environments/environment-dev.yml
pip install -e .
pytest -v -s
```
## PyPI installation

Install the requirements (e.g. the conda env above) and install from PyPI.
This should work on both MacOS and Linux/PC:

```bash
conda activate kernelforge-dev
pip install kernelforge
```
This will install pre-compiled wheels with gfortran and linked againts OpenBLAS on Linux and Accelerate on MacOS.
If you want to use MKL or other BLAS/LAPACK libraries, you need to compile from source, see below.


## Intel compilers and MKL

It is 2025 so you can `sudo apt get install intel-basekit` on Linux/PC to get the compilers and MKL.
Then set up the environment variables:
```bash
source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
```
In this case, MKL will be autodetected by some CMake magic. If you additionally want to compile with Intel compilers, you can set the environment variables when running `pip install`:
```bash
CC=icx CXX=icpx FC=ifx make install
```

In my experience, GCC/G++/GFortran with OpenBLAS is very similar to Intel API alternatives in terms of performance, perhaps even better.
On MacOS, GNU compilers with `-framework Accelerate` for BLAS/LAPACK is the default and is very fast on M-series macs.

## Timings
I've rewritten a few of the kernels from the original QML code completely in C++.
There are performance gains in most cases.
These are primarily due to better use of BLAS routines for calculating, for example, Gramian sub-matrices with chunked DGEMM/DSYRK calls, etc.
In the gradient and Hessian matrices there are also some algorithmic improvement and pre-computed terms.
Memory usage might be a bit higher, but this could be optimized with more fine-graind chunking if needed.
More is coming as I find the time ...

Some speedups vs the original QML code are shown below:

| Benchmark | QML [s] | Kernelforge [s] |
|:---------------|------------:|--------------------:|
| Upper triangle Gaussian kernel (16K x 16K) | 1.82 | 0.64 |
| 1K FCHL19 descriptors (1K) | ? | 0.43 |
| 1K FCHL19 descriptors+jacobian (1K) | ? | 0.62 |
| FCHL19 Local Gaussian scalar kernel (10K x 10K) | 76.81 | 18.15 |
| FCHL19 Local Gaussian gradient kernel (1K x 2700K) | 32.54 | 1.52 |
| FCHL19 Local Gaussian Hessian kernel (5400K x 5400K) | 29.68 | 2.05 |

## TODO list

The goal is to remove pain-points of existing QML libraries
- Removal of Fortran dependencies
  - No Fortran-ordered arrays
  - No Fortran compilers needed
- Simplified build system
  - No cooked F2PY/Meson build system, just CMake and Pybind11
- Improved use of BLAS routines, with built-in chunking to avoid memory explosions
- Better use of pre-computed terms for single-point inference/MD kernels
- Low overhead with Pybind11 shims and better aligned memory?
- Simplified entrypoints that are compatible with RDKit, ASE, Scikit-learn, etc.
  - A few high-level functions that do the most common tasks efficiently and correctly
- Efficient FCHL19 out-of-the-box
  - Fast training with random Fourier features
  - With derivatives
